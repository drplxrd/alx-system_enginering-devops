# Dev ops assignment alx - Web infrastructure design

[]: # To this one:
[]: # # 0x09. Web infrastructure design

## 0x09. Web infrastructure design

[]: # ## Requirements
[]: # ### General
[]: # * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
[]: # * For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
[]: # * This project will be manually reviewed:
[]: # * As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
[]: # * Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](https://imgur.com/) but feel free to use anything you want).
[]: # * For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
[]: # * After pushing your answer file to Github, insert the Github file link into the URL box
[]: # * You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
[]: # * Focus on what you are being asked:
[]: # * Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
[]: # * Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
[]: # * Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
[]: # * In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
[]: # * Assume each whiteboarding session lasts 30 minutes
[]: # * Write all of your tasks in a file named 0-answer.txt
[]: # * Your file should contain the exact command(s) you used to solve the tasks
[]: # * If the task does not have an answer file, you can use a screenshot(s). Insert the link(s) into your answer file
[]: # * After pushing your answer file to Github, insert the Github file link into the URL box
[]: # * You will have to explain what is happening to the interviewer:
[]: # * Create a new git repository for each task (i.e. 0x01-answer, 0x02-answer, etc.)
[]: # * You need to have a README.md at the root of the project directory
[]: # * Push the answer files to Github, in your own repository
